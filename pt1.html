	<h1> The choice </h1>
	
	<p id="talk">
	Destiny often chooses the hero, yet the hero almost always is too blind to see what
	is right there before their very eyes.
	Our very sight is one that causes
	a false dilema, and I would be a fool to tell you to not to continue
	for, a hero, like you, to be here in our life is a rare sight indeed.
